    <p>
      Hey there 👋 I'm <strong>Adhitya Raman</strong> — a cloud and cybersecurity enthusiast passionate about
      understanding how systems work behind the scenes. I’m currently building deeper knowledge in 
      <strong>AWS</strong>, <strong>GCP</strong>, and modern networking concepts.
    </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy solving technical challenges, designing reliable cloud environments, and learning by doing. Whether it’s 
      experimenting with new tools, setting up cloud architectures, or attending security workshops — 
      I love pushing myself to grow every day.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm also strongly invested in <strong>cybersecurity</strong>, especially secure communication, cryptography, 
      packet analysis, and real-world defense strategies. I’ve participated in multiple hands-on labs and seminars to improve my skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a <strong>multi-lingual</strong> person who loves technology, I enjoy connecting with diverse people, exploring new 
      <strong>AI tools</strong>, and using <strong>prompt engineering</strong> to automate processes and bring ideas to life.
    </p>

    <p>
      At my core, I believe in consistent growth — learning, experimenting, and becoming better every single day.
